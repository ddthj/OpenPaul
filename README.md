__Paul, by Marvin, GooseFairy, and Brom__

Paul is a set of tools we made in an effort to approach strategy more efficently.

Paul works with paths, which are lines draw from point-to-point in order to accomplish some state
Events can also be added to paths, which control the path speed, jumps, etc. Events are NOT fully implemented.

In the master branch most of these tools are undisturbed, in the shooter circles branch paths are
made of lines and circles and the bot is capeable of playing a game.

Most of the documentation is buried in code comments, have a look if you're curious.
